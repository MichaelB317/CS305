Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. They are in the financial business as their name implies, they work to develop financial plans for people of all walks of life, and at all age ranges. In their business security is a must, so it makes sense that this is one of their main concerns. Additionally, in modernizing their operations, we needed to consider how the systems could be made efficient and user friendly.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe I proposed a good mitigation plan. While it was my first attempt, I believe I was able to formulate a proper plan that could act as a sort of road map moving forward. We should always endeavor to write efficient but secure code, as our user's security should be our top priority, as I believe it is their top priority. Lives could be ruined if we fail in this duty. When a company is secure, it can be trusted and its' users can rest easy. This builds a level of trust and reputation for the company which can lead to prosperity and growth.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found static testing to be rather difficult as I had no experience with Maven, and encountered numerous issues when trying to produce a dependency report. Thankfully I managed to overcome these road blocks, but they were challenging none the less.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security with redundant security methods and suggesting routine maintenance so that software was up to date, hopefully mitigating the overall number of vulnerabilities. For the future, I believe those kinds of decisions should be made based on experience, and being well read. The longer you spend in a field, the more tricks you pick up, so I believe it is always best to trust in experience, whether it be my own, a mentor, or a coworker.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

by running the static testing, and using a find command you can check for additional vulnerabilities, as far as securing the software application, the biggest issues were input validation, and secure connection. Proper certificates, and input validating before data can reach the back end should eliminate those issues.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Flow charts or pseudo code are always good resources to have on hand when writing a new project, while keeping an original copy of existing projects is a good habit incase you screw up the original while editing. It is good to keep check points that you can jump back to incase your logic doesn't work out. As far as coding practices, I believe I should stop being so stubborn and try asking for help more often. I did ask for more help during this course then I normally would, but I could have communicated my issues better, and been better at responding when help was offered.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I once again would fall back on the mitigation plan I proposed and explain, as well as my initial assessment, explaining how even with little understanding of application, cyber security, and the process of securing software, I was still able to adequately locate potential vulnerabilities and propose solutions to these problems.
